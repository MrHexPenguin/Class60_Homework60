            <p> Pokèmon Cards are really cool. You can buy different packs and get better cards. You can trade, collect, and build your deck to battle. Pokèmon is really fun. There over 600 different types of cards. But be careful, if you get some things on Amazon® or Ebay®, they could be fake.  Always check the price to make sure it isn't to expensive nor cheap. </p>
